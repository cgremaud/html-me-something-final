            <h2>The Philosophy of Memes</h2>
         
         <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;While at first "memes" may seem a silly or insignificant subject for academic study, their rapidly growing prominence as a cultural phenomenon demands that such a serious study be made. This page is not intended to be a broad overview of the entire cultural phenomenon of "memes" per se, but rather an intimate study of a few particularly interesting examples of memes with a philosophical or political intent. Most of the examples here were taken from the online sub-culture known as "leftbook" or "philbook." This community grew out of several facebook groups in the middle 2010s in reaction to broader changes in society, technology and culture. "Leftist" memes are often characterized by "walls of text" or references to European philosophy - primarily in the Marxist, anarchist, and socialist traditions.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;I will examine a few prototypical examples of "philbook" memes below.
