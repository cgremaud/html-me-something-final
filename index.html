            <h2>The Philosophy of Memes</h2>
         
         <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While at first "memes" may seem a silly or insignificant subject for academic study, their rapidly growing prominence as a cultural phenomenon demands that such a serious study be made. Over the past decade, the rapid growth of online subcultures and social media has inevitably collided with the upcoming generation of young academics and scholars leading to a groundswell of memes on topics of esoteric and academic interest that may seem inaccessible or jargon-laced to the layperson. This page is not intended to be a broad overview of the entire cultural phenomenon of "memes" per se, but rather an intimate study of a few particularly interesting examples of memes with a philosophical or political intent generated by people involved in academia and philosophy. Most of the examples here were taken from the online sub-culture known as "leftbook" or "philbook." This community grew out of several facebook groups in the middle 2010s in reaction to broader changes in society, technology and culture. Such "philbook" memes are often characterized by "walls of text" or references to European philosophy - primarily of the continental tradition. 
         </p>
         <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will examine a few prototypical examples of "philbook" memes below.
            <p><em>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content warnings for mental health and suicide.</em></p>

               <p>1. The Hegelian Dialectic</p>
               <img class = "center" src = "/img/hegel dialectic brain expander.jpg" alt="A hegel brain expansion meme." />
            </p>    
            <p>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fairly simple and classic example of a philosophical concept expressed within an image macro format. The "shell" or format here is the "brain expansion" meme which indicates a progression from "stupid" to "smart". The repetition of the "Hegel was right" text alternating with the "Hegel was wrong" text indicates both the process of the Hegelian dialectic as well as reflects the trends in Hegel's popularity as a thinker over the centuries.

            <p>2. Analytics in the pool</p>
            <img class = "center" src = "/img/analytics in the pool.jpg" />
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Analytic/Continental" divide is one of the primary "culture wars" in the field of academic philosophy. Analytics like Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein try to overcome the vagueness of natural language by attempting to create an idealized language free of vagueness and ambiguity. The philbook community generally stems from the continental tradition and thus the analytics tend to be treated with gentle mockery. This meme illustrates how analytic language structures are viewed as rickety, unsafe or poorly thought out. </p>

            <h2>3. OC Creations</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am but an interested layman, and not a certified professional philosophy memer like many of my online compatriots, I have made a few contributions to the broader meme-discourse universe. Below are a few that I'm particularly fond of. </p>
            <p>1. L. Ron Fisher</p>
            <img class="center" src="/img/l ron fisher.jpg" alt="A picture of L. Ron Hubbard with the caption'the current ruling ontology denies all possibility of an extraterrestrial cause of mental illness'"/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I'm particularly proud of the level of meta-reference going on here, I must give credit to my friend Ian for coming up with the joke. I just put the elements together. This meme references the work of Mark Fisher and L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard was obviously a charlatan, but he had certain, shall we say, "interesting" views about mental illness (i.e. that mental illness is caused by alien ghosts infecting our souls). Mark Fisher, on the other hand, was one of the most prominent and important recent theorists of mental illness. Fisher sadly took his own life in 2017 but before then he wrote a great deal about how our mental health is intimately intertwined with our environment. His most salient quote on this issue comes from his work "Capitalist Realism." He writes: "The current ruling ontology denies any possibility of a social causation of mental illness." I reference that line here by having L. Ron express that society denies any possibility of an extraterrestrial cause of mental illness.  </p>
